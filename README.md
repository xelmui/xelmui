## Empowering the Songjourney
We believe that being more productive and efficient as music creators and curators we have to see the whole process at once. Xelmui aims to change the way musicians collaborate with industry players. We want to empower creators to really emphasize the possibilites of project management thinking and catalogue organisation to create better music and be more productive. And in the end to be a happier creator.
